<p>I am currently a Research Associate at Mayo Clinic, where I conduct clinical research focus on interstitial lung disesase, 
    carpal tunnel syndrome, penile dysfunction, glaucoma, unilateral papilledema, etc</p>

<p>Before Mayo Clinic, I was a research fellow at University of South Carolina, where I worked on 
    vascular biomechanics using mechanical testing and numerical modeling. </p>

<p>I obtained my Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering at University of South Carolina, advised by Prof. <a href="http://eecs.berkeley.edu/~trevor/">Tarek Shazly</a>. 
   I obtained my bachelor degree from Harbin Institute of Technology, China.</p>

<p>I have a track record of creating and contributing to open source libraries.</p>

<p>My major interest is on the ultrasound elastography and vascular biomechanics. </p>

<p>I do have a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/boran-zhou-75a26358/">LinkedIn profile</a>.</p>

My current research topics include:
    <ul>
        <li> Using ultrasound elastography for asessing elasticity of soft tissue.
        <li> using deep learning to predict lung mass density. 
        <li> using convolutional neural network for medical image classfication.
    </ul>
